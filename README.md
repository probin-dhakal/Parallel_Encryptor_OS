A **high-performance parallel file encryption and decryption system** built using **modern C++17**, multithreading, job queue scheduling, and synchronized worker threads.

This project demonstrates concepts used in **Operating Systems**, **Concurrency**, and **Systems Programming**.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ Parallel Encryption | Encrypts multiple files simultaneously using worker threads |
| 🔄 Thread-Safe Scheduling | Uses a synchronized job queue with mutex + condition variables |
| 🔑 Educational Cipher | Simple XOR logic for clarity and extendability |
| 📊 Performance Measurement | Displays accurate execution time |
| 🧱 Modular Architecture | Plug-and-play replacement for AES, ChaCha20, etc. |

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

### 1) Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/parallel_encryptor.git
cd parallel_encryptor

2) Create and Enter Build Directory
  mkdir build && cd build
3) Configure and Build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build .
  This produces an executable named: ./main


🚀 Usage

Place the input files (a.txt, b.txt, etc.) in the build directory, then run:
  ./main

Example Interaction

Enter encryption key: secret
Enter files to encrypt (space separated, end with #): a.txt b.txt #
[Thread 1] Encrypting a.txt -> a.txt.enc
[Thread 2] Encrypting b.txt -> b.txt.enc
✅ Encryption done in 0.041 seconds!

=== Decryption Stage ===
[Decrypted Data from a.txt.enc]: hey dude how are you
[Decrypted Data from b.txt.enc]: i am fine thank you

✅ Decryption Complete. Files restored.
Encrypted files are saved as:
  filename.txt.enc
Decrypted files are saved as:
  filename.txt.dec


🧠 How It Works

| Component    | Responsibility                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Encryptor`  | Reads/writes files, applies XOR encryption/decryption |
| `JobQueue`   | Thread-safe FIFO queue for task dispatch              |
| `ThreadPool` | Launches worker threads that process encryption jobs  |
| `main.cpp`   | Collects input, schedules tasks, measures performance |

Worker count = number of input files → maximized parallel throughput.
